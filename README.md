# Dynamic-Load-Balancer
Load balancing among the servers in a datacenter using feedback
1.The load is defined as CPU time.
2.The algorithm is feedback based.
3.The traffc load is unequal.

Observations include the graphs of plot vs Feedbackfrequency. These graphs show how fast the goal is met when the frequency is changed.
